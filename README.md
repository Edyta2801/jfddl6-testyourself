This web site was developed as a project during our Junior Front-End Developer course.
It engages topics such as : 
- responsive web designing
- use of : css, html, media queries
- use of : javaScript+oop  
- writing a mini game in javascript etc...(add some more text or description later :) 

The main task was to design quiz web site, were you could choose the topic you are good at and have some 
fun in checking your knowledge.
